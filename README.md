# Am Git Book Contents

_Am Git_, by Allen B. Downey, is a modified version of _Pro Git_ by Scott Chabon.

Like the original, it is licensed under
the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 3.0 license.

I have modified only the first four chapters:

[Chapter 1: Version control](https://github.com/AllenDowney/amgit/blob/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.markdown)

[Chapter 2: The first use case](https://github.com/AllenDowney/amgit/blob/master/en/02-git-basics/01-chapter2.markdown)

[Chapter 3: The second use case](https://github.com/AllenDowney/amgit/blob/master/en/03-git-branching/01-chapter3.markdown)

[Chapter 4: The third use case](https://github.com/AllenDowney/amgit/blob/master/en/04-git-server/01-chapter4.markdown)

In addition, I wrote [this guide to resolving merge conflicts with minimal pain](http://allendowney.github.io/amgit/conflict).
