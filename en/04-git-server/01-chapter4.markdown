## Adding files on Github ##



## Editing on GitHub ##

The project home page shows the name and project description, a list
of files, and the contents of README.md.

For a new project, README.md is usually the only file in the list.  If
you click on the blue filename, you will see the detail page for this
file.  Click "History" to see a list of commits that have modified
this file.  Click "Blame" to see history information in a different
format.  And click "Edit" to... you guessed it... edit the file.

The web editor on GitHub is useful for making small changes, but it is
not the most common way of modifying a repo.  And it is not
particularly safe.  If you are making substantial changes and want to
minimize the chance of losing work, I don't recommend using the web
editor.

Anyway, if you want to add more information to README.md, you can.  By
the way, "md" stands for Markdown, which is a markup language you can
use to format the contents of README.md.  This book is written in
Markdown.

When you are done editing, you can add comments in the "Commit
summary" and "Extended description" fields, and then hit "Commit
Changes".  The commit summary usually describes what was changed; the
description explains why.
